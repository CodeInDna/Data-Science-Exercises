    "**Note:** This quiz requires you to find an accuracy of 100% on the training set. Of course, this screams overfitting! If you pick very large values for your parameters, you will fit the training set very well, but it may not be the best model. Try to find the smallest possible parameters that do the job, which has less chance of overfitting, although this part won't be graded.\n",
