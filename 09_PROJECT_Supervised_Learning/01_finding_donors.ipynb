    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:** Ensemble methods are learning algorithms that construct a group of classifiers and then classify new data points by taking a (weighted) vote of their predictions. From the class video, we've got an intuition that ensemble methods can achieve a better performance. So I choose random forest and gradient boosting in the ensemble family. The third method I choose is logistic regression, which is a classical method for classification problem. Want to take a look how this one compare with the other two. In our condition, as we have a really large data with a lot of features, the following three models are good at handling large dataset and achieve accurate result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Random Forest:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Application:** Remote sensing (is a process to acquire, prepare, and decipher information of spectral and spatio-temporal nature on objects, phenomenon or areas under investigation without being in direct physical contact.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:** Overcome overfitiing compare with decision tree. High flexibility and accuracy. Can deal with unbalanced and missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weakness:** When you have a large collection of decision trees it is hard to have an intuitive grasp of the relationship existing in the input data. Higher complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Candidacy:** Random Forest is always a good start with such classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Gradient Boosting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Application:** Improving the separation of direct and diffuse solar radiation components using machine learning by gradient boosting. WOW, this is how machine learning can be useful in all type of studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:** Really powerful and normally outperform Random Forest. Typically using Decision Tree as weak leaner, but any other weak learner should also be used in a well coded gradient boosting algorithm. Gradient Boosting also able to handle different types of variable and also missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weakness:** Gradient Boosting has more hyper-parameters to tune than many other algorithms. Also more prone to overfitting. Very computational expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Candidacy**: With this sufficiently large dataset, gradient boosting is definetly worth trying.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Application:** Logistic regression has already been widely used in binary classification problems. Landslide susceptibility mapping using certainty factor, index of entropy and logistic regression models in GIS and their comparison at Mugling–Narayanghat road section in Nepal Himalaya.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:** Easy to implement and very efficient to train. Can be used to start with as a benchmark before more complicated models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weakness:** Logistic Regression is a generalized linear model, it's a strengths or weakness based on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Candidacy:** Also a good start with classic logistic regression. And we have a pretty clean dataset.\n",

    "**Answer:** In order to understand how Gradient Boosting work, we need to know what is decision tree and what is weak learner. Let's start with decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a \"test\" on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes). The paths from root to leaf represent classification rules. In our census data, we have 103 features after one-hot encoding to build up decision tree. For example, we can set a node as 'sex' and decide which direction to go whether this person is 'Male' or 'Female'. In addition to this, we can add more nodes like 'education_level' to advance our decision. At the end of the tree, we might predict a 'Male' with 'phD' degree has a higher chance to become a donor than a 'Female' with 'College' degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "A weak learner is any machine learning algorithm that gives better accuracy than simply guessing. For example, if we are trying to identify the type of flowers in a park. If we are just identifying all the flowers as 'rose', this algorithm would not be a weak leaner as the probably is not better than guessing. If we have another algorithm which can identify rose most of the time but not so good identifying other flowers like 'tulip'. This algorithm will be a weak learner as it is better than guessing is some area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to understand how Gradient Boosting works and how it is related to decision tree and weak learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting algorithms typically work by solving subsections of the problem, by peeling them away so future boosting iterations can solve the remaining sections. Imagine we have assembly line, each person normally work on the same part of the assembly line all the time. Which means each person is more familiar with their own task and specialize at certain task. The takeaway is that weak learners are best combined in a way that allows each one to solve a limited section of the problem. The most commonly used weak learner is decision tree while any other machine learning can be used as weak learner as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we can combine weak learners who are good at identifying whether the person is a donor based on different features. These learners are weak learner becuase they might made their decision only based on one or two features and the prediction is not accurate sometime. So during the training process, Gradient Boosting is actually build decision tree one by one. And the later trees are built based on the performance of the previous tree, various parameters are tuned to finish this process. In the end, we can achieve the final model which is an ensemble of a set of weak decision trees. And in this final model, all the weak learners make their vote to achive the final result whether an individual earns above 50k or not."

    "**Answer:** Pretty close, got the same result 4 out of 5. But I did not have the intuition how marriage status have such a huge weight at the beginning, maybe marriage status shows someone has certain high respossibility and also indicate a 'higher' age. We can see the total feature weight is around 60% which is really high. Which means these 5 features really made the decision. On the other hand, capital gain and loss has the highest weight as expected as they are most 'money' related which will influence the final income directly.\n",

    "**Resubmit Addition:** After I set the random_state number, we can see there is small difference occur between the Fscore and accuraccy. In this feature importance section, we can also see a new face 'hour-per-well', which means some of the features have similar importance and changing random_state will change the rank of the importance as well. On the other hand, 'hour-per-week' is pretty important as well and make sense, as one has a better chance to earn more money if one work a longer time.\n"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

Although these five features provide more than 50% weight of the final decision, other features also have very important impact as well. If the training time was a factor, for example if we are doing live estimation. I think reducing data will be a good choice as speed does matter in this condition. (On the other hand, the accuracy and F-score actually is pretty good and acceptable when we reducing the features.)"
