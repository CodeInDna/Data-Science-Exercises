The v transpose matrix is also a square matrix with the number of rows and columns equaling the number of items.\n\n 3. The sigma matrix is actually returned as just an array with 4 values.  \n\n In order to set up the matrices in a way that they can be multiplied together, we have a few steps to perform: \n\n 1. Turn sigma into a square matrix with the number of latent features we would like to keep. \n\n 2. Change the columns of u and the rows of v transpose to match this number of dimensions. \n\n If we would like to exactly re-create the user-movie matrix, we could choose to keep all of the latent features.")
